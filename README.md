# Embedded-Systems-Project

This repository contains an embedded C program for the LPC1768 microcontroller, which demonstrates Nokia keypad-style text input using a 4x4 matrix keypad and displays the decoded text on an LCD screen. The code is designed to scan the keypad for input, store the pressed keys in a queue, and then convert the multi-press Nokia-style input into readable text, which is then displayed on the LCD.
